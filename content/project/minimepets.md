# MiniMePets

Turn wolfs and cats into small players using a nametag. Have mini versions of yourself, friends, youtubers or whoever you want follow you around on adventures or populating your house. This change is just visual, so wolfs will still fight on your side, all of them take their usual food for breeding/healing and right-clicking will sit them down so they won't follow you around.

This mod is purely visual and fully clientside, it doesn't have to be installed on servers and works everywhere!
