# [WaveyCapes](/project/waveycapes) - 1.3.0-1.19.3 - Forge released
Download [this](https://modrinth.com/mod/kYuIpRLv/version/78vkUJkI) version or check out the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/kYuIpRLv) page!

Changelog: Added a new "Simulation V2" mode(new default setting). Allows the cape to move left and right slightly, prevents too-hard bends/cape clipping into itself, and entirely new underwater physics and behavior(unlike before, where it failed like the vanilla Minecraft cape).
Fixed a lot of edge cases, where the cape would become oddly thin, tilted, or inverted.
Using the Wind Mode "Waves" will now slow down while underwater.
