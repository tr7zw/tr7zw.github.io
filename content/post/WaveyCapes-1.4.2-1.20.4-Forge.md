# [WaveyCapes](/project/waveycapes) - 1.4.2-1.20.4 - Forge released
Download [this](https://modrinth.com/mod/kYuIpRLv/version/rgTKkx8G) version or check out the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/kYuIpRLv) page!

Changelog: * Update to 1.20.4
* ~~I won't be able to provide Forge versions of my mods for now. Consider updating to NeoForge or Fabric instead.~~ As you can see this is a Forge version, which in theory should work, in practice, Forge 1.20.4 doesn't run for me at all. The point still stands, stop using Forge!
