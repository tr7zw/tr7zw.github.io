Download [this](https://modrinth.com/mod/DynYZEae/version/2UOKWlBe) version or check out the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/DynYZEae) page!

Changelog: Due to so many people nagging about this version getting released, here it is.

Changes:
- Fixed the crosshair being solid white

Note: I entirely abandon 1.19.2. I don't intend to fix any not game-breaking bugs or do any more optimizations. Please just update to 1.19.4.
