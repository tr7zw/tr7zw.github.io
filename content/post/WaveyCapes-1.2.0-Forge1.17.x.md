Changelog: 

*Backport from 1.18 + new updates*

Fixed that the cape can stretch a bit when moving too fast

Made the vertical movement multiplication a config value

Fixed some internal issues

Jumping in place now still moves the cape slightly away, not just straight up

Fixed glitchy behavior that was rooted in the cape being influenced by the fps
