Changelog: Quick release before Mojang manages to release 1.20.2. This release contains major improvements and a bit of a surprise.

## 1.2.1 Changes:
* Fix Fast Crosshair using the wrong settings
* Update Crosshair when going into F5/changing to spectator mode

## 1.2.0 Changes:
* Partial (Neo)Forge Support (not all Fabric things are implemented in regards to Health/Armor/Food/Air bar)
* Render multiple buffered overlays in one draw call with a custom shader, increasing performance a lot
* Custom "Fast-Vignette" render mode that buffers the vignette to be rendered with other UI parts
* Optional fast cursor mode, it is a lot faster, but will remove the inverted color effect(this was a bug in older versions of Exordium, now it's an option)
* Added Polling setting. It reduces on how often parts check rather they need to update(Set this to your monitors refresh rate I'd say, so it checks for example 60 times per second rather the scoreboard changed, and only renders when it's actually different. Before it checked each frame which was too often)
* Update MixinExtras to 0.2.0-rc.2
* Fix hanging sign text rendering a block too low
* Fix config reset button not actually working(just visually)
* Update tablist on heart blink and username style change by @JustAlittleWolf in https://github.com/tr7zw/Exordium/pull/99
* Added a small text to the config screen to remind people that [supporting the dev is an option](https://tr7zw.dev/donate/) ðŸ˜‡

## Known issues, please don't report/ask:
* Nametag buffering is still broken
* Mod UI elements like minimaps are not buffered(Neither on NeoForged or Fabric)
* The better F3 slide-in animation is bound to the update rate, so it is laggy
