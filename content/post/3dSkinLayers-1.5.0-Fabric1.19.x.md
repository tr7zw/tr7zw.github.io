Changelog: Update for 1.19.x.

Added:
- Korean Translation(Thanks gyular)
- Czech Translation(Thanks HxxThSwggr)
- Traditional Chinese Translation(Thanks Miku)
- Start an API for other mods to use. Can currently create 3d models of textures and give access to the player model data. Also caused some internal refactoring for cleaner code separation.


Fixed:
- Player heads with "CustomModelData" tags won't be turned 3d to better support resource packs
- Prevent crashing to invalid HTTP textures
- Don't crash due to corrupted config files
