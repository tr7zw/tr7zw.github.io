Changelog: Smaller test release:

Fixes:

- Disabling the arm layers in the vanilla skin settings will still render them in first person

- Better compatibility with some other mods that modify the skin

 

This release contains a new side feature for people that donated via Ko-Fi: Custom Animated skins(like an optifine cape). I want to add this to all of my mods, so anyone using at least one of them can see these skins, but for now, it is only inside the 1.4.4 3d Skin Layers releases to test the waters(does my backend handle it/are there issues with other mods?).

This feature can globally be disabled via the new tr7zwDonorSettings.json file in the config folder.

Known issues about this: Old versions of the Physics mod will memory leak and crash your game after a few minutes. Update to the latest release to get this fixed.
