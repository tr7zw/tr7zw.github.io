Changelog: First of all, Happy New Year everyone(assuming this release works ðŸ˜…).
This is the first release using a new build system I've been working on that maintains 1.20.4-1.16.5 Fabric/Forge/NeoForge all in the same codebase. Assuming everything goes well, this means that 1.16.5, 1.17.1, 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.3, 1.19.4, 1.20.2 etc will all become supported and maintained, and contain all the latest and greatest features and bugfixes. 
Note: 1.8 and 1.12.2 remain unsupported, as the tooling around them is just bad, and their codebases are too different to keep in here.
## Changes
- Add 1.20.4 support(1.20.3 is skipped as there's no point to it)
- Add NeoForge support for 1.20.4 and 1.20.2
- Backporting all 1.20.2+ changes/fixes to <= 1.19.4(1.16.5 Forge got a config screen for example ðŸ™ƒ, also 1.16.5 in general now will render player-heads in 3d)
