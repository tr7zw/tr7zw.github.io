Changelog: Major rework of the entire mod. This release contains 4 months of changes, so please report any problems on Github! This changelog will be missing things, check out the full changelog for all changes(162 commits).

## TLDR changes
* New resource pack format, allowing more control and freedom(old packs will still work, check the build in back for examples)
* Reworked the entire default pack
* Reworked the UI system, adding side navigations, menus, allowing the use of the right mouse button, and fixing optifine support
* Many new options in the settings like tooltips/moving the camera while using lists
* Refill button, filling up stacks inside the inventory using items from shulkers
* Opening and getting items from shulkers by selecting them from the inventory view
* New utility buttons to re-grab the last grabbed item(for example after it runs out) and stashing the selected item back into the inventory
* Remember server enable choices, so it won't be asking every time after joining on an unsupported server(revoke choices via the settings screen)
