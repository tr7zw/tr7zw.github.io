# [3d Skin Layers](/project/3dskinlayers) - 1.6.1-1.20.4 - Fabric released
Download [this](https://modrinth.com/mod/zV5r3pPn/version/UxVYrBiD) version or check out the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/zV5r3pPn) page!

Changelog: ## Changes
- Fixed 1.16.5 not running with Java 8
- Updated the German language file
- More build system fixes (I hope I don't have to manually edit the 40 files title again)
- (forgot to mention in 1.6.0: the mod id everywhere is now "skinlayers3d", even on fabric)

Note: Some mods interfacing with 3d skin layers like [ETF] Entity Texture Features will require an update to work again with 1.6.0+. If you need ETF or other mods that got broken by the update, use the old version until they have time to update for the new release.
