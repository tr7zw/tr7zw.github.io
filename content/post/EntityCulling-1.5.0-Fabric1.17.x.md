Download [this](https://modrinth.com/mod/NNAgCjsB/version/2mzFyULh) version or check out the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/NNAgCjsB) page!

Changelog: This release fixes a long-going bug where under really odd conditions Block-Entities turn invisible.

I'm glad to say that this bug is gone!

Also re-enabled performance optimizations that were disabled because of this issue(10-20% faster).
