- ✅ = Supported
- ❌ = Not supported
- 🚧 = Work in progress
- 🕓 = Planned
- ⚠️ = Partially supported(Might get critical updates, but no new features/regular updates)
- 🧶 = Fabric only
- 🔨 = Forge only

## Notes

- 1.20.3, 1.15.x, 1.14.x, 1.13.x, 1.11.x, 1.10.x 1.9.x, 1.7.x and anything older will not get any versions of mods. Please don't ask for them.

## Priorities

- Fabric is more important than NeoForge
- NeoForge is more important than Forge
- Sodium+Iris is more important than Optifine
- Latest version is more important than older versions(1.19>1.18)
- Legacy versions(1.8, 1.12, 1.16) are not a priority and most mods will not be backported to them
- Latest minor version is always more important than older minor versions(1.19.4>1.19.2)
