✅ = Supported, ❌ = Not supported, 🚧 = Work in progress, 🕓 = Planned, ⚠️ = Partially supported, 🧶 = Fabric only, 🔨 = Forge only

## Priorities

- Fabric is more important than Forge
- Sodium+Iris is more important than Optifine
- Latest version is more important than older versions(1.19>1.18)
- Legacy versions(1.8, 1.12, 1.16) are not a priority and most mods will not be backported to them
