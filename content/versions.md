- ✅ = Supported
- ❌ = Not supported
- 🚧 = Work in progress
- 🕓 = Planned
- ⚠️ = Partially supported(Gets irregular updates)
- 🧶 = Fabric only
- 🔨 = Forge only
- 🪄 = Direct Fork Backport(Based on the latest MC release version)

## Priorities

- Fabric is more important than Forge
- Sodium+Iris is more important than Optifine
- Latest version is more important than older versions(1.19>1.18)
- Legacy versions(1.8, 1.12, 1.16) are not a priority and most mods will not be backported to them
- Latest minor version is always more important than older minor versions(1.19.3>1.19.2)
