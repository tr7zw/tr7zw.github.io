# Don't use Sinytra Connector

If you ended up on this site, good chance you tried loading one of my Fabric mods on Forge using Sinytra Connector. This is a bad idea. It's a hacky solution that can't work well. It's better to use  Fabric instead, or wait for the official Forge support (most of my mods are already available for Forge/NeoForge). If there is no Forge version available, then the Fabric version in combination of Sinytra Connector won't work either.

Also on a side note, never contact Fabric mod developers for support when using Sinytra Connector, it's not their responsibility to fix issues caused by it, so please don't bother them with it.

Mods that won't work with Sinytra Connector and currently have no Forge version available:

- ItemSwapper
- Exordium
- ModelDumper

If you are not trying to use one of these mods, you downloaded the Fabric version of one of my other mods. Please download the correct version for Forge.
